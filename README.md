# express-react

This repo shows a basic express app which uses React for server side rendering.

## Installation

Installation should be completed using the command `npm install`.

Before running, the React must be compiled into JavaScript that can be understood by the browser. In order to do that run `npm run build`.

This step may take awhile as Babel and Webpack work their magic.

Finally, run `npm start` to start the server.
